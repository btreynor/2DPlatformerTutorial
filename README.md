# FirstPlatformer
All credit goes to KaarinGaming on YouTube for his terrific tutorial!  After following his tutorial on creating a 2-D Platformer, I have learned so much more about the Java language!  This platformer includes music, multiple levels, enemies and more!  Follow KaarinGaming on YouTube and if you like his content, buy him a tea if you can!
